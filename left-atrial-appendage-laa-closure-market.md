<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epicardial LAA Closure Device</li><li>Endocardial LAA Closure Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure market comprises two primary types: epicardial and endocardial devices. Epicardial LAA closure devices are placed on the outside of the heart, typically during open-heart surgery, providing a more direct approach to occluding the appendage. In contrast, endocardial devices are delivered via catheter through blood vessels, allowing for minimally invasive procedures. Both approaches aim to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation by preventing blood clots that can form in the LAA.</p></p>
